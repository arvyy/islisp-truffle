= ISLISP tests

Tests consist of source input (ending with .lisp) and expected standard output from running it (file with same name but ending with .expect.txt). A passing test must match its standard stream output with file content.

Tests inside `portable` should pass under any ISLISP compliant implementation, not just this one. However, this requires minor preparation: each occurrence of `(requires "testing.lisp")` needs to be textually replaced with contents of `portable/testtemplate.lisp.txt` before running.

These tests are ran using truffle-islisp using `mvn test` invocation from the root.

To run portable tests using a different implementation, invoke `testrunner.sh` and pass the interpreter call command which includes `FILE` parameter that will be substituted by actual testing file at runtime. For example, `./testrunner.sh 'eisl -s FILE'`
