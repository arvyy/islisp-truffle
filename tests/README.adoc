= ISLISP tests

Tests consist of source input (ending with .lisp) and expected standard output from running it (file with same name but ending with .expect.txt). A passing test must match its standard stream output with file content. Tests inside `portable` should pass under any ISLISP compliant implementation, not just this one.

Currently, the tests are ran from java through `mvn test`. A pure shell runner is planned.
