= Benchmarks

Benchmarks are compared against SBCL and CCL Common-Lisp implementations. ISLISP code is straightforward to transpose to CL, the risk that benchmarks compare different code is minimal.

The sourcecode of benchmarks can be found under `/benchmarks/src` directory in the source repository.
